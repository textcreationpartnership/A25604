            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> RECEIVED yours, and in purſuance of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, my ſelf, with ſome others, have made it our Buſineſs to procure Subſcriptions to a Petition (humbly deſiring our Captain that his Council may ſit on the day prefix'd) in which undertaking we have not been a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcourag'd for (which you'd hardly believe) not one in fifteen throughout the whole Ship would ſubſcribe; nay, on the contrary, ſome there were on Board us, who inſtead of ſetting one hand to it, fail'd not to uſe both and tore it; but we have call'd them to accompt for it, though we fear to little purpoſe: but this uſage has not wholly diſheartned us, for by fair words to ſome, and threatning ſpeeches to others, when we ſaw a Sailor in quandary whether he ſhould ſet Pen to Paper or no, we told him there was no greater Teſt to prove him either an Algerine or a Chriſtian; by which, and with other means, we have muſtered a conſiderable number of hands: but becauſe I will not flatter your expectation, with ſhadows inſtead of real ſubſtances; to deal truly with you, they are moſt of them but the Riff-raff of our Ship; but ſuch as they were, ſome half a ſcore of our principal Fore-maſt-men humbly preſented it to our Captain; but, Bleſs me! had you but ſeen how diſdainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56481:2"/>he received both them and their Cables length of Scrawles; for indeed moſt of them were no other, for firſt you had a Name or two written in a tolerable hand, but then three or four Marks inſtead of Names, purſued them; which our Captain took for Hebrew Characters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>YOU may remember you mentioned two pernicious Paſſengers lying on Board us in our great Cabbin. Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have nearer Two Score, and ſome of them of dangerous conſequence; in particular, one who has ſo often chang'd his Religion, when there has been alteration of Commanders, that he ſcarce knows what Government he would have aboard us; beſides many others, who are daily buzzing in our Captains Ears, that were we not aſſured of his great Conduct, ſome of them e're this time had betray'd us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Enemies hands: As to the Sultaneſs, there is great hopes ſhe will (in a Pinnace of the Captains) leave our Ship and return to <hi>Algiers,</hi> the place of her Nativity; but for the Renegado we are like to be peſtered longer with him; for we have had Advice from aboard the Pinnace he ſtear'd, that he bred ſuch Diſſentions between the Sailors and their Captain, that 'tis thought, if ever they catch him aboard their Pinnace again, they'll Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale him.</p>
            <p>I thought convenient to acquaint you, That our Council of War have Tried Five Muſſullmen, and have found them guilty of High Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, in that they have by Order ot their Mufti read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> publickly, and have endeavoured to Algerize ſome Chriſtians; for which Facts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law they have received Sentence of being Tied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Further, I muſt acquaint you, That one of the Chief of our Council of War has been charg'd with a little under-hand Dealings, by brow-beating our Material Evidence, and privately ſetting on Shore ſome Mahometans charg'd as Actors or Abettors in the Conſpiracy; chiefly the diſcharging our Chirurgeons Mate, when ſo clear Evidence appear'd againſt him; how he will clear himſelf of theſe and other Crimes, he is charged with, my next ſhall inform you.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you an Impartial Account of our preſent unhappy Condition, which cannot but amaze you and the reſt of our Worthy Owners, to whom I deſire you would be pleaſed to impart this; and what other Tranſactions offers, you ſhall have by my next: Yet doubting not but our BRAVE CAPTAIN will by his Mature Courage and Conduct, uſe his utmoſt Endeavour for the due Proſecution of our Enemies; which will much exhilerate the hearts of our Ships Company, and eſpecially the Heart of</p>
